# Sperlingskauz - Projekt 2020

Covid-19 prevented me from teaching my students in practical zoological exercises and in ornithological field excursions. In March 2020 in Germany, leaving the house was only possible for doing sports and buying food.

So, I thought: lets do some sports! I left my house for sports, entered the huge mixed forest behind our house and put out twelve time-scheduled audio recorders for about one week.

The aim was to detect Eurasian Pygmy Owl which I knew was breeding in small numbers in the forest, but was quite a challenge to detect.

In the consequence, I gave 40,000 minutes of WAV audio recordings to my students (67 participants) and told them to search for Pygmy Owl within these recordings and write a report on this, which would make up their exam in my course. At the same time, I used a kind of machine learning algorithm monitoR (Katz et al. 2016) to automatically detect the species in the recordings.

Additionally, a group of regional specialised ornithologists also made a survey in the same sites, so the competitive challenge could start!

The students found Pygmy Owl vocalisations in all sites except one 

Time-scheduled recordings of animal vocals with subsequent automatic classification can deliver a nice piece of additoonal information and can largely save time and money for nature conservation work! 

Also, it can help to keep students doing valuable stuff in Covid-19 situations :-).
