# Sperlingskauz - Projekt 2020

Covid-19 prevented me from teaching my students in practical zoological exercises and in ornithological field excursions. In March 2020 in Germany, leaving the house was only possible for doing sports and buying food.

So, I thought: lets do some sports! I left my house for sports, entered the huge mixed forest behind our house and put out time-scheduled audio recorders for about one week.

The aim was to detect Eurasian Pygmy Owl which I knew was breeding in small numbers in the forest, but was quite a challenge to detect.

In the consequence, I gave 40,000 minutes of WAV audio recordings to my students and told them to search for Pygmy Owl within these recordings and write a report on this, which would make up their exam in my course. At the same time, I used monitoR (Katz et al. 2016) to automatically detect the species in the recordings.
